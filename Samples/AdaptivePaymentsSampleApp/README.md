Overview
--------

The AdaptivePayment Sample project is an API scratch pad application that allows you to play around
with the Adaptive Payment APIs. This application is a handy complement to the API reference guides 
available on x.com. All forms are provided with default values for the mandatory parameters for
each API.

The samples also demonstrate how you can use the SDK to call the API methods in your own application.
